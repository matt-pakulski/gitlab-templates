# Tests mirroring from one gitlab repo to another gitlab repo using https

# Job 'push-commit:gitlab-https-to-gitlab-https' clones the source repo, creates a commit to it, and pushes the repo
# Job 'gitlab-https-to-gitlab-https' performs the clone from the source repo to the target repo (located in examples/ directory)
# Job 'verify:gitlab-https-to-gitlab-https' verifies that the commit that was added to the source repo is present in the target repo
